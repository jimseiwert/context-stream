**ContextStream** is an open-source platform that brings the power of AI-driven semantic search to your documentation. Whether you're building an internal knowledge base, indexing your company's docs, or just want to search through your favorite frameworks' documentation faster, ContextStream has you covered.

## ✨ Why ContextStream?

Traditional documentation search relies on keyword matching, which often misses the mark. ContextStream uses **AI embeddings and semantic search** to understand what you're actually asking for - not just matching keywords, but understanding intent and context.

- 🧠 **Semantic Search**: Ask questions naturally, get relevant answers
- 🔌 **Multiple Sources**: GitHub repos, websites, wikis, and more
- 💬 **AI Chat Interface**: Ask questions, get answers from your docs
- 🔄 **Auto-Sync**: Keep your docs fresh with automatic updates
- 🎯 **MCP Integration**: Works with Claude and other AI coding assistants
- 🔐 **Privacy-First**: Self-hosted, your data stays yours
- 🚀 **Fast & Efficient**: Hybrid BM25 + vector search for optimal results

curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/context-stream/main/docker/docker-compose.bundle.yml

# Create environment file
cat > .env << EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
EOF

# Start ContextStream
docker-compose up -d

# Visit http://localhost:3000 🎉
```

That's it! You now have your own AI-powered documentation search engine running locally.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Developer Teams**: Index your internal wikis, API docs, and codebases
- **Content Teams**: Search through marketing materials, guides, and knowledge bases
- **Students/Researchers**: Build a personal search engine for your research papers and notes
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Make your project's docs more discoverable
- **AI Coding Assistants**: Use with Claude Code or other AI tools via MCP

## 🐳 Deployment Options

Choose the deployment that fits your needs:

### Bundle (Easiest)
Perfect for getting started or small teams. Everything in one container.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  jimseiwert/context-stream:bundle-latest
```

### Docker Compose (Recommended)
