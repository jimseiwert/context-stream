# Product Plan: ContextStream MCP
## AI-Powered Documentation & Codebase Context Platform

---

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
ContextStream is like having a smart librarian who reads and remembers everything about your favorite websites and code projects, then helps you find exactly what you need through AI conversations.

### Problem Statement
**Who experiences it:** Developers, technical writers, DevRel engineers, and AI/LLM users constantly struggle with providing accurate, up-to-date context about codebases, documentation sites, and technical resources to their AI tools.

**Why it matters:**
- Developers waste 2-3 hours daily searching through documentation across multiple sources
- LLMs hallucinate when lacking proper context about specific frameworks, libraries, or internal tools
- Manually copying documentation into AI chat contexts is tedious, error-prone, and limited by token constraints
- Existing solutions (bookmarks, notes apps, copy-paste) don't integrate with modern AI workflows
- Documentation goes stale quickly but developers continue referencing outdated information

### Solution Approach
ContextStream provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that intelligently scrapes, indexes, and serves documentation and codebase context directly to AI tools through a standardized protocol.

**Why this is the right solution:**
- MCP is the emerging standard for AI tool integration (backed by Anthropic)
- Server-based architecture allows real-time updates and centralized knowledge management
- HTTP streaming enables efficient handling of large documentation sets
- Eliminates context-switching between documentation sites and AI chat interfaces

**Alternatives considered:**
1. **Browser Extension** - Limited to browser context, doesn't integrate with IDEs or CLI tools
2. **RAG-based Chatbot** - Requires hosting LLM infrastructure, higher cost, vendor lock-in
3. **Static Documentation Generator** - No real-time updates, no AI integration
4. **Simple Web Scraper** - Doesn't solve the AI context injection problem

#### Feature 1.1: Website Scraping & Indexing Engine

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want to add a documentation website URL and have it automatically scraped and indexed, so that I can quickly make that knowledge available to my AI tools without manual copying.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given a valid documentation website URL (e.g., https://docs.python.org/3/)
When I add it to ContextStream via CLI command `contextstream add <url>`
Then the system should:
- Validate the URL is accessible (returns 200 status)
- Discover all linked pages within the same domain
- Scrape HTML content and extract main documentation text
- Parse metadata (title, description, code blocks, headings)
- Index content into searchable database
- Complete indexing within 10 minutes for sites up to 500 pages
- Display progress indicator showing X/Y pages scraped
- Notify on completion with summary (pages indexed, errors, storage used)

Given an invalid URL or inaccessible website
When I attempt to add it
Then the system should:
- Return clear error message indicating the issue (404, timeout, SSL error, etc.)
- Not create a partial/corrupted index
- Suggest troubleshooting steps (check URL, verify SSL cert, etc.)

Given a previously indexed website
When I run `contextstream update <domain>`
Then the system should:
- Re-scrape only pages that have changed (check last-modified, etag)
- Add newly discovered pages
- Mark deleted pages as archived
- Complete incremental update 80% faster than full re-index

**Edge Cases:**
- Rate limiting: Respect robots.txt and implement exponential backoff
- JavaScript-rendered content: Detect and optionally use headless browser
- Authentication required: Support basic auth and cookie-based auth
- Redirects and moved pages: Follow and update index
- Large sites (1000+ pages): Stream indexing, show progress, allow pause/resume
- Duplicate content: Detect and deduplicate
- Non-English content: Detect language, support UTF-8
- Binary files (PDFs): Extract text content from PDFs if present

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have) - Core functionality that defines the product

**Dependencies:**
- Database schema for storing scraped content
- HTTP client with retry logic and rate limiting
- HTML parser (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Cheerio)
- Optional: Headless browser (Playwright/Puppeteer) for JS-heavy sites

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must handle websites with different structures (Docusaurus, Nextra, GitBook, custom)
- Memory efficient for large sites (stream processing, not load entire site in memory)
- Resilient to network failures (save progress, resume on restart)
- Configurable concurrency (default 5 concurrent requests, max 20)

**UX Considerations:**
- Clear progress feedback (terminal progress bar or dashboard)
- Ability to cancel long-running scrapes
- Preview of scraped content to verify quality
- Warnings for common issues (missing content, blocked by robots.txt)

---

**User Story:**
As a Claude Desktop user, I want to connect ContextStream as an MCP server so that Claude can automatically access my indexed documentation when answering my questions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given ContextStream is running as an MCP server
When I configure Claude Desktop with the MCP server endpoint
Then Claude Desktop should:
- Successfully connect to the MCP server on startup
- Display ContextStream in the MCP servers list
- Show status indicator (connected/disconnected)

Given Claude receives a user query about indexed documentation
When the query matches content in ContextStream index
Then the MCP server should:
- Receive the query context from Claude
- Search indexed content using semantic and keyword search
- Rank results by relevance (BM25 + embedding similarity)
- Return top 5-10 most relevant documentation sections
- Include metadata (source URL, last updated, section title)
- Stream results to avoid timeout for large content
- Complete search and return results within 2 seconds (p95)

Given the indexed documentation is large (>100MB text)
When Claude requests context
Then the system should:
- Prioritize most relevant sections to fit within Claude's context window
- Return content in structured format (JSON with source citations)
- Support pagination if Claude requests more results
- Compress redundant information

**Edge Cases:**
- MCP server crashes: Auto-restart, notify user of disconnection
- Network interruption: Graceful reconnection, queue pending requests
- Multiple simultaneous MCP clients: Handle concurrent requests
- Query doesn't match any indexed content: Return helpful "no results" message
- Ambiguous query: Return diverse results from multiple documentation sources
- Real-time updates: Reflect newly indexed content immediately

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have) - Core functionality that defines the product

**Dependencies:**
- MCP protocol implementation (Anthropic's MCP SDK)
- Vector database or embedding search (e.g., Qdrant, Weaviate, or simple pgvector)
- Embedding model for semantic search (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, local model)
- HTTP server with streaming support

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must implement MCP specification correctly for Claude compatibility

- Color-coded status (green=healthy, yellow=stale, red=error)

Given I want to update a stale documentation source
When I run `contextstream update react.dev` or `contextstream update --all`
Then the system should:
- Re-scrape changed pages
- Show diff summary (X pages added, Y updated, Z removed)
- Update "last updated" timestamp

Given I want to remove a documentation source
When I run `contextstream remove react.dev`
Then the system should:
- Prompt for confirmation (with --force flag to skip)
- Delete indexed content from database
- Free up storage space
- Remove from MCP server results immediately

Given I want to search locally (without MCP)
When I run `contextstream search "useState hook"`
Then the system should:

As a system administrator, I want scraped content to be stored efficiently and retrieved quickly so that the MCP server can respond to queries within 2 seconds even with large documentation sets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given a freshly scraped documentation page
When it is being stored
Then the system should:
- Extract and store: URL, title, HTML content, plain text, metadata, timestamps
- Generate embeddings for semantic search (chunked to 512 tokens)
- Store in both full-text search index and vector database
- Deduplicate identical content across pages
- Compress stored content (target 50% size reduction)
- Complete storage operation within 500ms per page

Given a search query from MCP client
When the system performs retrieval
Then it should:
- Execute parallel keyword (BM25) and semantic (vector) search
- Combine and rank results using hybrid scoring
- Return top 10 results within 1.5 seconds (p95)
- Include snippets with highlighted query terms
- Provide source metadata (URL, title, last updated)

Given storage exceeds 10GB
When performing queries
Then the system should:
- Maintain sub-2-second query performance
- Support pagination for large result sets
- Implement query caching for repeated searches

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given ContextStream is installed for the first time
When I run `contextstream init`
Then the system should:
- Create default config file at `~/.contextstream/config.yaml`
- Generate secure random values for any secrets
- Display config file location
- Open file in default editor (optional)
- Include inline comments explaining each setting

Given I want to customize scraping behavior
When I edit the config file with:
```yaml
scraping:
  max_concurrent_requests: 10
  respect_robots_txt: true
  user_agent: "ContextStream/1.0"
  timeout_seconds: 30
  max_pages_per_domain: 1000
```
Then the scraper should:
- Use these settings on next scrape operation
- Validate settings on startup (reject invalid values)
- Warn if settings may cause issues (e.g., too high concurrency)

Given I need to configure embedding provider
When I set in config:
```yaml
embeddings:
  provider: openai  # or 'local' for offline
  model: text-embedding-3-small
  api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}  # environment variable
```
Then the system should:
- Load API key from environment variable
- Fail gracefully if API key is missing
- Switch providers without losing existing embeddings

Given I want to change storage location
When I set `storage.data_dir: /custom/path`
Then the system should:
- Use that directory for database and indexed content
- Create directory if it doesn't exist
- Migrate existing data if already configured

**Edge Cases:**
- Invalid YAML syntax: Show line number and error details
- Missing required settings: Use sensible defaults, warn user

As an MCP user, I want documentation to be intelligently chunked and summarized so that Claude receives the most relevant information without exceeding context limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given a long documentation page (10k+ words)
When it's being indexed
Then the system should:
- Split into semantic chunks (by heading hierarchy, topics)
- Generate summary for each chunk
- Create overall page summary
- Maintain relationships between chunks

Given a user query matches a long document
When MCP serves the context
Then it should:
- Return the most relevant chunks (not entire page)
- Include page summary for context

As a team lead, I want to share curated documentation collections with my team so that everyone has access to the same high-quality, pre-indexed knowledge base.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given I've built a comprehensive workspace
When I run `contextstream export --workspace teamdocs`
Then it should:
- Export configuration and indexed content to shareable format
- Include metadata (update schedules, custom settings)
- Support encryption for private documentation

Given a team member receives the export
When they run `contextstream import teamdocs.zip`
Then they should:
- Get fully indexed workspace without re-scraping
- Be able to update from original sources
- Merge with existing workspaces or keep separate

**Priority:** P2 (Could Have) - Valuable for teams, but individual use works for MVP

---

#### Feature 3.2: Custom Scrapers & Parsers

**User Story:**
As a power user, I want to write custom scrapers for non-standard documentation formats so that I can index internal wikis, Notion pages, or proprietary documentation systems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given a custom documentation system
When I write a scraper plugin
Then I should be able to:
- Use plugin API to fetch content
- Transform to standardized format
- Register plugin with `contextstream plugin install ./my-scraper`
- Use with `contextstream add <url> --parser my-scraper`

**Priority:** P2 (Could Have) - Extends use cases significantly

---

#### Feature 3.3: Analytics & Usage Insights

**User Story:**
As a DevRel engineer, I want to see which parts of my documentation are most queried through MCP so that I can identify gaps and improve high-traffic areas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given MCP queries are being logged
When I run `contextstream analytics`
Then I should see:
- Most queried topics/pages
- Search queries with no good results
- Documentation sections never accessed
- User satisfaction proxy metrics (click-through rates, time spent)

**Priority:** P2 (Could Have) - Valuable for documentation maintainers

---

#### Feature 3.4: Offline Mode with Local Embeddings

**User Story:**
As a security-conscious user, I want to run ContextStream entirely offline without sending data to external APIs so that I can use it with proprietary/confidential documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given I configure local embeddings
When I index documentation
Then the system should:
- Use local embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers)
- Store all data locally
- Work without internet connection
- Provide comparable search quality to cloud embeddings

**Priority:** P1 (Should Have) - Critical for enterprise adoption

---

#### Feature 3.5: Integration with Other MCP Servers

**User Story:**
As an advanced MCP user, I want ContextStream to work alongside other MCP servers (like file system, database servers) so that Claude can combine multiple knowledge sources.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given multiple MCP servers are configured
When Claude receives a complex query
Then it should:

### Technology Stack Recommendations

**Backend (MCP Server & Indexing):**
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
  - Rationale: Rich ecosystem for ML/embeddings, web scraping, MCP SDK available
  - Alternative: TypeScript/Node.js if team preference
- **MCP SDK:** Anthropic's official MCP Python SDK
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI (async, high performance, great docs)
- **Scraping:**
  - `httpx` for HTTP requests (async, HTTP/2 support)
  - `BeautifulSoup4` + `lxml` for HTML parsing
  - `Playwright` (optional) for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Code Parsing:** Tree-sitter (multi-language AST parsing)
- **Embeddings:**
  - Primary: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cost-effective, good quality)
  - Fallback: sentence-transformers (local, offline mode)

**Database & Search:**
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
  - Rationale: Single database for relational + vector + full-text search
  - Reduces operational complexity vs. multiple databases
- **Caching:** Redis (optional, for query cache and job queue)
- **Search Strategy:** Hybrid BM25 (PostgreSQL FTS) + vector similarity

**CLI:**
- **Framework:** Click or Typer (modern, type-safe CLI framework)
- **Progress:** Rich (beautiful terminal formatting, progress bars)
- **Configuration:** Pydantic + PyYAML (type-safe config parsing)

**Infrastructure:**
- **Process Management:** systemd (Linux) or Docker Compose
- **Logging:** structlog (structured, JSON logging)
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana (optional, Phase 2)
- **Task Scheduling:** APScheduler (for auto-updates)

**Frontend (Phase 2+):**
- **Framework:** Next.js (React) or SvelteKit
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query)

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Decision 1: Single Database vs. Specialized Components

**Choice:** PostgreSQL with pgvector for everything (relational + vector + FTS)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler operations (one database to manage, backup, scale)
- PostgreSQL FTS is good enough for documentation search
- pgvector performance sufficient for <10M vectors
- ACID guarantees for consistency
- Cost-effective for self-hosted deployments

**Trade-offs:**
- May need to migrate to specialized vector DB (Qdrant, Weaviate) at scale (>10M docs)
- Less optimized than dedicated search engines (Elasticsearch)

**When to revisit:** If query latency exceeds 3 seconds or dataset exceeds 10M pages

---

#### Decision 2: Embedding Provider

**Choice:** Hybrid approach - OpenAI API by default, local models for offline

**Rationale:**
- OpenAI embeddings: High quality, cost-effective ($0.02/1M tokens), simple API
- Local models (sentence-transformers): Offline support, no external dependencies
- Users can choose based on privacy/cost requirements

**Trade-offs:**
- OpenAI dependency creates privacy concerns for some users
- Local models require more storage and compute
- Need to support both code paths

**When to revisit:** If OpenAI costs become prohibitive (>$100/month for average user)

---

#### Decision 3: Scraping Architecture

**Choice:** Async scraping with job queue (in-process initially, Redis optional)

**Rationale:**
- Async (httpx + asyncio) handles high concurrency efficiently
- Job queue allows pause/resume, progress tracking
- In-process queue (Python queue) sufficient for MVP
- Can upgrade to Redis queue for distributed workers later

**Trade-offs:**
- In-process queue doesn't survive restarts (need to save state)
- Can't scale horizontally without Redis/RabbitMQ

**When to revisit:** When single scraper instance can't keep up with demand

---

#### Decision 4: MCP Implementation

**Choice:** Use Anthropic's official MCP SDK, implement as HTTP streaming server

**Rationale:**
- Official SDK ensures protocol compliance
- HTTP streaming handles large content efficiently
- Future-proof as MCP evolves

**Trade-offs:**
- MCP is early-stage, spec may change
- Limited documentation and examples currently

**When to revisit:** If MCP spec changes significantly or better alternatives emerge

---

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: MCP Protocol Changes
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Description:** MCP is an early-stage protocol from Anthropic. Spec may change, breaking compatibility.

**Mitigation:**
- Abstract MCP implementation behind interface (easy to swap)
- Monitor Anthropic's MCP repo closely
- Participate in MCP community discussions
- Version our MCP implementation to support multiple spec versions

**Contingency:**
- If MCP becomes unusable, pivot to direct Claude API integration
- Support alternative protocols (OpenAI plugins, LangChain tools)

---

#### Risk 2: Scraping Reliability
**Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:** Documentation sites have diverse structures, anti-scraping measures, JS-heavy rendering. May fail to index some sites.

**Mitigation:**
- Support multiple scraping strategies (simple HTTP, headless browser)
- Provide manual override/configuration options
- Build parser for popular doc frameworks (Docusaurus, Nextra, GitBook)
- Clear error messages to help users troubleshoot

**Contingency:**
- Plugin system for custom parsers (Phase 2)
- Community-contributed parsers for difficult sites
- Manual HTML upload option for truly inaccessible sites

---

#### Risk 3: Performance at Scale
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Description:** As users index millions of pages, query performance may degrade below 2-second target.

**Mitigation:**
- Benchmark with large datasets early (simulate 10M pages)
- Implement caching aggressively (query results, embeddings)
- Database optimization (proper indexing, query tuning)
- Horizontal scaling architecture from Phase 2

**Contingency:**
- Move to specialized vector database (Qdrant, Weaviate)
- Implement result pagination/streaming
- Per-user rate limiting if needed

---

### Market Risks

#### Risk 4: Competition from Anthropic/OpenAI
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Very High

**Description:** Anthropic or OpenAI could build similar functionality natively into Claude/ChatGPT, making ContextStream obsolete.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on features big players won't prioritize (self-hosting, custom sources)
- Build strong open-source community (hard to compete with free + community)
- Differentiate on privacy, customization, developer experience
- Pivot to complementary features (analytics, team collaboration)

**Contingency:**
- Position as "power user" tool for advanced use cases
- Partner with Anthropic/OpenAI as community-driven extension
- Pivot to enterprise features (on-prem, compliance, team management)

---

#### Risk 5: Low Adoption / Product-Market Fit
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Very High

**Description:** Developers may not find enough value to adopt, or prefer existing tools (Dash, DevDocs).

**Mitigation:**
- Validate problem extensively in alpha/beta (100+ user interviews)
- Measure time saved quantitatively (not just qualitative feedback)
- Iterate quickly based on feedback (weekly releases in beta)
- Lower barrier to entry (one-command install, great docs)

**Contingency:**
- Pivot target audience (focus on segment with strongest signal)
- Narrow scope (e.g., GitHub-only tool, or web docs only)
- Explore alternative use cases (documentation testing, discoverability analytics)

---

### Business Risks (Future)

#### Risk 6: Open Source Sustainability
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:** If product is fully open-source, may struggle to generate revenue to sustain development.

**Mitigation:**
- Build hosted/managed version for non-technical users (Phase 4)
- Enterprise features (SSO, compliance, support SLAs) as paid tiers
- GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective for community funding
- Dual-license model (open core)

**Contingency:**
- Treat as open-source community project with corporate sponsorship
- Offer consulting/implementation services for enterprises
- Partner with hosting providers (revenue share)
