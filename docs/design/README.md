## Design Principles

### 1. Developer-First
**Target Users:** AI-first developers, DevRel engineers, engineering managers

**Implications:**
- Keyboard-driven workflows (shortcuts like `/` for search)
- Dense information display (developers can handle complexity)
- Terminal-inspired aesthetics
- Fast, minimal animations
- Dark mode as default

### 2. Bold Simplicity
**What it means:**
- Every element has a purpose (no decorative fluff)
- Clear visual hierarchy using size, weight, color
- Generous whitespace for breathing room
- One primary action per screen section
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

**What it doesn't mean:**
- Boring or minimal (bold ‚â† decoration, simple ‚â† empty)
- Removing helpful guidance or context

### 3. Speed & Efficiency
**Performance Targets:**
- Page load: <1 second
- Search results: <2 seconds
- Smooth 60 FPS interactions
- Instant feedback on actions

**UX Efficiency:**
- Minimize clicks to accomplish tasks
- Provide keyboard shortcuts
- Show loading states immediately
- Allow background operations

### 4. Trustworthy & Transparent
**Why developers need to trust ContextStream:**
- They're giving us their documentation (sensitive)
- Results inform critical decisions
- Integration with AI workflows requires accuracy

**How we build trust:**
- Show data sources for search results
- Display last updated timestamps
- Expose system status (indexing progress, errors)
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- No hidden magic (explain what's happening)

### 5. Accessible by Default
**Commitment:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum (AAA where feasible)
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- Screen reader optimized
- Respect user motion preferences
- Clear focus indicators

**Why it matters:**
- Legal compliance
- Broader user base (developers with disabilities exist)
- Better UX for everyone (keyboard users, mobile, etc.)
- Future-proof (voice control, AI assistants)

## Target User Personas

### Alex - AI-First Developer
**Profile:** 29, Senior Full-Stack Developer
**Needs:** Fast access to accurate, up-to-date docs while coding with Claude
**Pain Points:** Outdated AI responses, copy-pasting docs, context limits
**Workflow:** Heavy keyboard user, multiple monitors, dark mode always

### Jordan - DevRel Engineer
**Profile:** 34, Developer Relations at open-source framework
**Needs:** Ensure docs are AI-accessible, track what's being searched
**Pain Points:** Community asks already-answered questions, fragmented docs
**Workflow:** Content creation, community support, analytics monitoring

### Morgan - Engineering Manager
**Profile:** 42, Platform Team Manager
**Needs:** Team knowledge management, reduce onboarding time
**Pain Points:** Scattered internal docs, tribal knowledge, slow onboarding
**Workflow:** Strategic planning, team productivity, tool evaluation

### Sam - Independent Consultant
**Profile:** 37, Technical Consultant
**Needs:** Quick context switching between client projects
**Pain Points:** Multiple tech stacks, billable hours spent researching
**Workflow:** Multi-project juggling, efficiency-focused, cloud-sync needed

---

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Dark Mode as Default?
**Rationale:**
- Target users are developers who typically use dark editors
- Reduces eye strain during long sessions
- Terminal/command-line aesthetic feels familiar
- Developer tool convention (GitHub, VS Code, Dash, DevDocs)

**Implementation:** Still provide light mode, but optimize for dark first.

---

### Why Minimal Animations?
**Rationale:**
- Developers prioritize speed over polish
- Animations can feel like delays if overused
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Developer tools (terminals, IDEs) rarely animate

**Implementation:** Fast transitions (100-200ms), no decorative effects, functional only (loading, state changes, navigation).

---

### Why Keyboard-First Navigation?
**Rationale:**
- Developers rarely leave keyboard while coding
- Efficiency over mouse precision
- Terminal muscle memory (Vim, Emacs shortcuts)
- Accessibility benefit (screen readers, motor disabilities)

**Implementation:** `/` for search, `Esc` for close, arrow keys for lists, tab for navigation, visible focus.

---

### Why shadcn/ui Over Other Component Libraries?
**Rationale:**
- Copy-paste approach (full code ownership, no npm bloat)
- Radix UI primitives (accessible by default)
- Tailwind CSS integration (consistent with our system)
- Highly customizable (not opinionated styles)
- Modern stack (React Server Components, TypeScript)

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Material UI:** Too opinionated, Google aesthetic doesn't fit
- **Chakra UI:** Runtime styles, heavier bundle size
- **Ant Design:** Enterprise/admin aesthetic, not developer tool
- **Headless UI:** Good, but shadcn/ui provides more batteries-included

---

### Why Inter & JetBrains Mono?
**Rationale:**
- **Inter:** Designed for UIs, legible at small sizes, open-source, widely adopted
- **JetBrains Mono:** Developer-focused, excellent ligatures, clear character differentiation (0/O, 1/l/I)

**Alternatives considered:**
- **SF Pro / System Fonts:** Good fallback, but Inter is more refined
- **IBM Plex:** Excellent, but Inter has better small-size legibility
- **Fira Code:** Great ligatures, but JetBrains Mono is more modern
